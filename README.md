# MyComputerArchitectureProjects
Developments of my RISCV32I Otter CPU from my assembly class into certain computer architecture ascpects. Focusing on:
- Classic 5-stage Pipeline (IF/DE/EX/MEM/WB)
- 2-way set associative Cache
- Combining the two to have a complete implementation of a beefed-up Otter CPU
